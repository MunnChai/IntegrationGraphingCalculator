# **Integration Calculator and Graphing**

## **Introduction**

This program is a graphing calculator designed to help students and learners currently studying calculus. Users can input a function to be graphed, as well as the desired integration bounds, and be presented with both the graph of the function, as well as a visual representation of the integral within the graph. 


#

## **Functionality**

- The user can input a variety of functions, including **trigonometric and logarithmic functions**, to be graphed.
- The graph's bounds can be edited by typing the desired bounds or by **dragging one's mouse** to move around a graph, or **scrolling the mouse wheel** to zoom in and out.
- The program will color in the **area from the function's curve to the x axis** within the desired integration bounds. 
- **Keyboard input** is accepted. (Keybinds shown below)

## **Keyboard Input**

| Keybind | Output |
|---------|--------|
| **0 - 9** | 0 - 9 | 
| ***, /, +, -, ^** | *, รท, +, -, ^ |
| **(, )** | (, ) |
| **S** | sin( |
| **C** | cos( |
| **T** | tan( |
| **L** | ln( |
| **E** | e (Euler's number)|
| **P** | ฯ |
| **X** | x |
| **Backspace**| removes a character |
| **Delete** | clears current input |

## **Limitations**
The program calculates integrals using summations, so the result is can be imprecise. Due to these calculations, it also struggles to handle functions that have asymptotic behaviour (eg. *1/x, tan(x), etc*).

This calculator cannot handle extremely large or small numbers.
